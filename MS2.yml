  Our project is a single-player Poker game with a terminal-based user 
  interface. It supports all features of the Texas Hold'em variant of poker 
  during each round of betting, including checking, betting, raising, calling, 
  and folding. Even better, our player may choose to play against a maximum of 
  ten skilled AI opponents.
